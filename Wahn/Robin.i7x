		say "     The air in what was once a sprawling public park hangs thick and humid, heavy with the scent of overgrown greenery. Towering, unfamiliar foliage chokes out the sky, transforming cracked asphalt paths into barely discernible tunnels. Far off, beyond the cacophony of rustling leaves and buzzing insects, faint grunts and ecstatic moans drift on the stifled breeze - distant echoes of the nanite apocalypse's ceaseless, lust-fueled transformations. You push through a curtain of thorny vines, your boots crunching on unseen debris, the exploration feeling less like a stroll and more like navigating a primeval wilderness. This altered world, even in its quiet corners, vibrates with a raw, unpredictable energy, a constant reminder of how deeply everything has changed. The remnants of old park benches lie swallowed by creeping vines, twisted metal slides emerge from thickets, and the air itself seems to shimmer with unseen life, a constant hum of the nanites['] work reshaping the very ecosystem around you.";
		say "     A thick, gnarled root, seemingly alive, suddenly snakes out, snagging your boot. You stumble, losing balance, a quick jolt of alarm running through you as the plant creature tries to pull you deeper into the undergrowth. With a grunt, you wrench your foot free, the root retracting with a frustrated rustle, and scramble backward blindly, pushing through a dense bush. In your hurried retreat, your hand bumps hard against something firm, yet surprisingly warm and slick with an odd goop. A jolt of caution courses through you, instincts screaming 'nanites!' You snatch your hand away, pulling it back to see a glistening transfer of sticky residue across your palm. Thankfully, no immediate tingling or strange sensations follow, and the goop has only a faint, sweet smell, like melted sugar and something vaguely organic. Relieved, you wipe your hand vigorously on the overgrown grass. Turning to investigate the mysterious object, you find a brightly colored Easter egg, a chocolate candy egg encased in a sugar shell, still slick with that peculiar goop and faintly warm to the touch, nestled impossibly among the wild growth.

You snatch the brightly colored Easter egg, wiping its peculiar goop onto the grass before securing the solid, chocolate mass in your pack. A quick glance over the high, wild grass reveals subtle disturbances – bent stalks, a slight depression, almost as if something large, yet light-footed, has recently passed through. Following this faint trace, you take a few cautious steps down what might once have been a path, your eyes constantly scanning the dense foliage. The trail quickly peters out, yielding no further discoveries, so with a frustrated sigh, you double back. A different direction, past those particularly dense bushes over there, seems promising, a new target in your peculiar scavenger hunt. The thrill of the chase, even for something so strange, pulls you deeper into the overgrown wilderness of the park.";
				say "     Pushing through a curtain of thorny vines and ancient, gnarled roots, you emerge into a small clearing. Bingo! Another brightly colored egg, this one a vibrant green, gleams faintly on the ground, slick with fresh goop. You're definitely on the right trail now! A renewed sense of purpose invigorates you, and with heightened caution, you follow the subtle signs of passage – bent grass, disturbed leaves – that wind deeper into the overgrown wilderness. A third egg, a shimmering violet, appears in short order, almost too easy to find. The trail leads you to a thick, unruly hedge. From just behind it, distinct sounds of heavy breathing and straining reach your ears, a series of low grunts and soft whimpers. Curiosity burning, you carefully part a gap in the dense foliage, peering through. There, squatting in the verdant undergrowth, is a tall, slender anthro bunny with soft grey fur and digitigrade legs, his eyes squeezed shut with exertion. As you watch, a blue speckled egg, slick and shining with 'natural' lubrication, crowns from his anus and plops onto the grass, accompanied by an almost orgasmic sigh from the bunny.";

It feels substantial in your hand, a satisfying weight, slightly larger than a chicken egg. Wiping the peculiar goop off its slick surface onto a tuft of grass, you quickly slide the solid, chunky chocolate mass into your backpack. This isn't just a novelty; it's high-density sustenance, a valuable find in a world where food is scarce. Who cares where it's coming from? A full belly means a longer survival. The mystery of its origin still pricks at your mind, however. As you turn to leave the overgrown park, a thought forms: perhaps there's an [bold type]Easter-Bunny Park Trail[roman type] here, worth revisiting for more such bizarre bounty in the future.";

You're not falling for that trick, nor risking infection from whatever goopy nanite-laced horror might have laid such a bizarre lure. Pivoting sharply, you retrace your steps, pushing through the tangled undergrowth with renewed urgency. The rhythmic sounds of the overgrown park, distant moans and rustling leaves, seem to press in on you now, no longer a backdrop but a warning. You tell yourself to avoid such obvious temptations in the future, reminding yourself that in this transformed world, nothing is ever as innocent as it seems. As you move away, the strange sight of the warm, slick Easter egg and the mystery of its origin linger for a while, a peculiar anomaly in a chaotic reality, but eventually, you manage to push it from your mind, focusing instead on the more immediate threats and necessities of survival.";

Your boots crunch over cracked pavement, barely discernible beneath explosive growth, as you navigate the wilderness where trails once lay. Distant moans and grunts, stark reminders of the nanite apocalypse's ceaseless transformations, drift on the humid breeze. Suddenly, a glint of vibrant color catches your eye near a tangle of gnarled roots. You spot it – another Easter egg, brightly colored, nestled impossibly in the wild foliage. A strange sense of deja vu washes over you, remembering the first time you found such an anomaly, its perplexing warmth and slick goop.";

A quick glance around confirms no immediate danger, so you secure this new find. A few steps further, almost too easily, a third brightly colored egg reveals itself, equally warm and glistening. You collect it, securing both newfound treasures in your pack. Pushing through a particularly dense thicket, distinct sounds of heavy breathing and straining reach your ears from just beyond a thick hedge. A series of low grunts and soft whimpers accompany a rhythmic, squelching sound. Curiosity burning, you carefully part a gap in the dense foliage, peering through.

He jumps, startled, his long grey ears twitching, one blue and one green eye snapping open wide in surprise as he spots you. His lithe body tenses for a moment, poised for flight, but you offer no aggressive moves. As he catches sight of the eggs you've already collected in your hand, a slow, playful grin spreads across his muzzle. He stands, his slender, tall frame straightening to its full height, rosy pink paw pads gently pressing into the grass, his cute tail giving a nervous, then excited flick. Looking at him from closer up, you realize he isn't fully naked, as there's a slender band of a black collar around his neck, and a little triangle of a red thong covers his crotch, with its thin strings around the hips almost vanishing in the fluffy fur of his body. 'Oops! Hey there,' he giggles, his voice light and airy, an innocent sound belying the scene you just witnessed. 'Looks like you found my stash. You weren't supposed to find me, though. At least that's what she said...'";
			say "     'I'm Robin, by the way,' the bunny introduces himself, extending a delicate paw, still slightly slick with residue from his recent delivery. You ask who 'she' is, your gaze lingering on the now-visible, slick remnants around his anus and the faint sheen on his fur. Robin blushes, a faint pink dusting his grey cheeks. He tucks his chin, a playful bashfulness in his demeanor. 'Oh, Micaela,' he giggles. 'She's a really nice bunny gal, over in the forest. You know, bet you can find her yourself if you go [bold type]scavenging for Easter eggs[roman type] over there.' Robin pauses, a shiver of pleasure running through his lithe body as he strokes a hand along his long ears, a clear memory taking hold. 'She gave me such a good filling, then sent me out to spread the fun. Ever since she rammed that big schlong of hers up my ass, I've become so neat and bunny-shaped.' He fondles his cute tail, a subtle arch of his back emphasizing the changes.";

'I was actually about to go find some handsome guy to, well, egg me up some more. Would save me a trip, and you,' he adds, whirling around with a flirty twitch of his cute tail, his naked rear now fully presented, 'you look pretty delicious.' His naturally lubed anus, still glistening from his last delivery, practically winks at you. 'What do you say, big guy? Wanna give a bunny a filling?' He looks back over his shoulder, one ear flopping slightly, his eyes burning with an eager, slutty invitation, ready for another round of nanite-fueled procreation.";

Robin squeals with delight, his mismatched eyes lighting up like he's just been given the biggest carrot in the world. He wastes no time, immediately dropping to his knees in the lush grass. With practiced ease, he lowers his chest to the ground, arching his back and sticking his fluffy rear high into the air. His cute, cotton-ball tail wiggles frantically, framing the main attraction: his wet, pink anus, already glistening and stretched from his recent deliveries, not at all hidden behind the delicate red string of his thong that lies between his furry buttocks. It pulses invitingly, a warm, messy bullseye that seems to beg for attention. He looks back over his shoulder, biting his lip playfully. 'Oh, you're gonna love this,' he giggles, giving his hips a little shake that makes his whole rear end jiggle. 'I'm all primed and ready for a big, hard filling. Don't keep a bunny waiting!'";
						say "     You step up behind the eager lagomorph, guiding yourself towards his waiting heat, tugging the thong's string aside with a single finger. The entry is impossibly smooth; the strange, sweet-smelling biological lubricant he produces for egg-laying works wonders for this purpose as well. As you slide into him, Robin lets out a long, shaky moan that vibrates through his slender frame. He pushes back against you, impaling himself further with desperate need, taking every inch you have to offer. His internal walls are incredibly hot and soft, wrapping around you with a grip that is both yielding and firm. 'Mmm, fuck yes,' he chatters breathlessly, his ears flopping with the rhythm of your thrusts. 'That fits so perfectly! It feels even better than laying them, honestly. Just get right in there and stir up my insides.'";
						WaitLineBreak;
						say "     As you establish a rhythm, pounding into his furry backside, Robin proves to be an incredibly vocal and active partner. He pants and moans, meeting your thrusts with enthusiastic bucks of his hips. 'You know,' he gasps between impacts, 'I wasn't half bad at taking dick when I was human, but ever since I got turned into this? It's like I was made for it.' Suddenly, you feel a startling, intense sensation rippling along your shaft. It feels like a living wave of pressure, starting from deep inside his bowels and rolling outward, milking you with terrifying efficiency. 'Check this out,' he teases, his voice strained with pleasure. 'I learned a few new tricks. My insides... they know exactly what to do now.' The rolling wave squeezes you again, almost jerking you off hands-free inside his tight channel, a sensation so intense it nearly sends you over the edge right then and there.";
						say "     The combination of his tight, masterful hole and the wanton way he presents himself drives you past the point of no return. You grab his slender hips, digging your fingers into his grey fur, and drive into him with abandoning force. Robin screams in delight, urging you on. 'Yes! Do it! Egg me up! Fill my basket!' he cries out, his internal muscles clamping down hard on your shaft. You groan, unable to hold back, and bury yourself to the hilt, pumping wave after wave of hot seed deep into his guts. He takes it all, shuddering and twitching, his tail going wild as he absorbs your load. 'That's it... make those eggs...' he murmurs deliriously. You stay connected for a long moment, riding out the aftershocks, before finally pulling out, leaving the breathless bunny collapsed in the grass, filled to the brim and looking utterly satisfied with his 'hunt.' You can see his thong tented at the front with what seems like a relatively modest erection, its fabric soaked with the load he blew into it when you bred him.";

						say "     Slowly, the bunny boy gathers his wits, pushing himself up from the matted grass with a satisfied groan. He saunters over to you, his movements loose and languid, the red thong clinging damply to his crotch. Leaning in, he plants a soft, wet smooch right on your cheek, his mismatched eyes sparkling with affection. 'Mmm, won't be long now until I start feeling those eggs you just planted deep inside me,' he purrs, giving his slightly distended belly a loving rub. 'You keep searching the park, handsome. I bet you'll find your very own bunny eggs soon enough. I promise to hide them with so much loving care.' With a final, mischievous giggle, he reaches down, giving your heavy testicles a firm, happy grope of appreciation. Then, with a saucy wink, Robin turns and bounces off into the foliage, waving enthusiastically over his shoulder until the undergrowth swallows him up for your next meeting.";

Love carrots, obviously, and hopping around, and oh,' he pauses, a wicked glint in his mismatched eyes, 'getting absolutely filled up. Eighteen eggs so far today, can you believe it?' He winks, a slow, deliberate gesture. 'You could definitely add a few to that number, handsome. Seriously, being a bunny is fantastic. The energy, the twitchy nose, the… perks.' He gestures vaguely to his lower body. You take a moment to introduce yourself properly, sketching out your background and how you've been navigating the nanite chaos. Robin listens intently, his ears perked forward. 'Awesome to meet you,' he says brightly when you finish, his tail giving an impatient flick. 'But seriously, gotta fly. I wanna get egged up again, like, right now. So see ya soon! Gotta go find a guy to pound this fluffy booty properly.' With that, he gives a final, saucy wave and bounds off into the undergrowth, eager for his next encounter.";

'Well, a bunny's gotta keep spreading the fun somehow, right?' With a final, good-natured wink, the bunny boy gives an exaggerated hop, his digitigrade legs carrying him swiftly into the dense foliage, disappearing from sight in moments. The rustling of leaves and the faint, airy sound of his giggling fade rapidly, leaving you alone in the clearing, a handful of freshly laid, warm chocolate eggs and the lingering scent of his unique arousal the only evidence of your bizarre encounter.";

'Though, that's a bit of a trek through this crazy city, you know? All those strange new streets and critters. But a bunny's gotta do what a bunny's gotta do to spread the fun, right?'
